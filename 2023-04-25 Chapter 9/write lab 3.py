Using the robot.txt file:

1) Open the file robot.txt as read only

2) Open another file robot2.0.txt as append, 
so you can write to it.

3) Read robot .txt in one line at a time

4) Split the line into a list using the "," as a split parameter

5) Check to see if the second item on your list is "rgb-led".Â 
   -- If it is not, then write the line back out unchanged 
      to your new file
      
6) If it's found, check the next item   on the list, and see 
if it is a color like "red", green" blue" (how could you 
check a list of colors? maybe create a list of colors you 
can compare to)
  -- If it's one of the colors on your list, then write the 
     line back out unchanged to your new file
  -- Write out with the color changed to #FFFFFF if the color 
     is NOT on your color list
     
7) If it's found, check the next item on the list, and see if it has a # and does not have any ":" in the string.
  -- if it has #, but not ":", then write the line back out 
     unchanged to your new file

8) If it's found, check the next item on the list, and see if it has a # and does not have any ":" in the string.
  -- if it has #, and ":", then edit the format to remove the ":" 
     and then write the line back out to your new file

Example:

robot2,rgb-led,green,2021-05-24,09:53:49pm <-- Write out unchanged if the color is on your color list

robot2,rgb-led,forest,2021-05-24,09:53:49pm <-- Write out with the color changed to #FFFFFF if the color is NOT on your color list
robot2,led-3,on,2021-05-24,09:55:11pm <-- Write out unchanged
robot1,rgb-led,#FFFFFF,2022-05-03,01:59:55pm <-- Write out unchanged

robot2,rgb-led,#FF:00:FF,2022-05-03,03:57:30pm <-- Write out as #FF00FF, where you striped the ":" out of the list item
